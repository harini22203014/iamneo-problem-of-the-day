Given an array of n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue. We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the colors red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function. Use the Selection sort algorithm.

we are asked to use selection sort here,but we can also use some other optimal approach ,since the input value is gonna be 1 or 2 or 0
so we can also mark the occurences by creating variables which is incremented by traversing the array
You can also find it here in this repository.
input:
6
2 0 2 1 1 0

output:
0 0 1 1 2 2
